# User Behavior Insights

UBI (or User Behavior Insights) is a(nother) naive attempt to create **a standard open source format to define and share user event tracking information**. The format is defined as a JSON Schema to validate queries and events defined as JSON files.

## ü•ò Why use it

Many Search teams struggle with understanding "Why is my user doing this".  They have great understanding of an incoming query and the documents returned, but no ability to connect that dot with an indicator of success, such as a click through event or event a add to cart.

There are A LOT of tools out there for tracking events, Google Analytics, Snowplow, etc, but each is a bit different, and each tends to lock you in.  None of them think about the needs of Search teams specifically either.

The User Behavior Insights standard attempts to provide a search focused standard that can operate across many platforms.

## ü™õ How to use it

The UBI standard is implemented by various platforms, and click through to learn more about using it with your chosen solution.
 * OpenSearch
 * [Apache Solr](https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2452)
 
UBI requires coordination between the client (a browser, a mobile app, etc) and the backend, which is documented using JSON Schema.  To validate 
You just need to copy, download or reference [the schema](https://github.com/o19s/ubi/blob/master/schema/schema.json) to validate an event, built as a JSON file from scratch, or a JSON generated previously (for example, [this sample](https://github.com/o19s/ubi/blob/master/samples/default_sample_ES.json)).  ** ERIC, what about query versus event **

To get started, you can copy both schema and sample in an **online validator** like [jsonschemavalidator.net](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/) or [liquid-technologies.com/online-json-schema-validator](https://www.liquid-technologies.com/online-json-schema-validator).

!["JSON Schema"](https://github.com/o19s/ubi/blob/master/assets/readme/MAC_online_validator_example.png?raw=true "JSON Schema")

You also have implementations to validate a JSON file programmatically in almost every coding language:

* [AVJ (JavaScript)](https://ajv.js.org/)
* [Snow (Java)](https://github.com/ssilverman/snowy-json)
* [jschon (Python)](https://jschon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* ... and [much more](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html)

> :warning: **The current MAC Schema has been designed using the 2019-09 Specification Draft**: When choosing a validator, please, check if it's compliant with the 2019-09 Draft. You can get much more information about the JSON Schema Specification in [json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org/).

You can check **examples of how to use code to create and validate MAC files** in the [MAC/scripts](https://github.com/getmanfred/mac/tree/master/scripts) directory.

The Schema is documented by itself, but it's much easier to get "the big picture" with [a graphical representation](https://github.com/getmanfred/mac/blob/master/assets/readme/MAC_diagram.png).

## üé® Who uses it

We are just trialing using UBI as an interchangeable format **to simplify their understanding of what their users are doing** and are looking for more collaborators.

## ü§ì Who we are

As common in new projects, the individual or group who started the project also administers the project, establishes its vision, and controls permissions to merge code into it. **We are thinking about how to establish a more robust governance structure**.
