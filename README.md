# User Behavior Insights

UBI (or User Behavior Insights) is a(nother) naive attempt to create **a standard open source format to define and share user event tracking information**. The format is defined as a JSON Schema to validate queries and events defined as JSON objects.

## ü•ò Why use it

Many Search teams struggle with understanding "Why is my user doing this".  They have great understanding of an incoming query and the documents returned, but no ability to connect that dot with an indicator of success, such as a click through event or event a add to cart.

There are A LOT of tools out there for tracking events, Google Analytics, Snowplow, etc, but each is a bit different, and each tends to lock you in.  None of them think about the needs of Search teams specifically either.

The User Behavior Insights standard attempts to provide a search focused standard that can operate across many platforms.  There are implementations for
 * [OpenSearch](https://github.com/o19s/documentation-website/tree/ubi-docs-consolidation/_search-plugins/ubi)
 * [Apache Solr](https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2452)


## ü™õ How to use it

 
UBI requires coordination between the client (a browser, a mobile app, etc) and the backend, which is documented using JSON Schema.  

| JSON Schema | HTML Docs |
| --- | --- |
 [query.request.schema.json](https://o19s.github.io/ubi/schema/query.request.schema.json) | [query.request.schema.html](https://o19s.github.io/ubi/docs/html/query.request.schema.html) |
| [query.response.schema.json](https://o19s.github.io/ubi/schema/query.response.schema.json) | [query.response.schema.html](https://o19s.github.io/ubi/docs/html/query.response.schema.html) |
| [event.schema.json](https://o19s.github.io/ubi/schema/event.schema.json) | [event.schema.html](https://o19s.github.io/ubi/docs/html/event.schema.html) |

To validate 
You just need to copy, download or reference one of the schema files to validate a UBI data structure, built as a JSON file from scratch, or a JSON generated previously (for example, [these samples](https://github.com/o19s/ubi/blob/master/samples/)).  

To get started, you can copy both schema and sample in an **online validator** like [jsonschemavalidator.net](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/) or [liquid-technologies.com/online-json-schema-validator](https://www.liquid-technologies.com/online-json-schema-validator).  Make sure to just copy the UBI related portions, and not any of the search engine specific code.  Here is the UBI portion from the file [query-solr.json](https://github.com/o19s/ubi/blob/master/samples/query-solr.json) for example:

```json
{
  "ubi": "true",
  "query_id": "xyz890",
  "user_query": {
    "query": "RAM memory",
    "experiment": "supersecret",
    "page": 1,
    "filter": "productStatus:available"
  }            
}
```

!["JSON Schema"](https://github.com/o19s/ubi/blob/master/assets/readme/MAC_online_validator_example.png?raw=true "JSON Schema")

You also have implementations to validate a JSON file programmatically in almost every [coding language](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html).

> :warning: **The current UBI Schema has been designed using the 2020-12 Specification Draft**: When choosing a validator, please, check if it's compliant with the 2020-12 Draft. You can get much more information about the JSON Schema Specification in [json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org/).

The Schema is documented by itself, but it's much easier to get "the big picture" with a graphical representation:

## üé® Who uses it

We are trialing UBI as an interchangeable format **to simplify understanding of what users are doing** and are looking for more collaborators.


## ü§ì Who we are

As common in new projects, the individual or group who started the project also administers the project, establishes its vision, and controls permissions to merge code into it. **We are thinking about how to establish a more robust governance structure**.
